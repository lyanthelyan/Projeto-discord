                <h1 class="card-title">How it started</h1>
                <p class="card-info">Game developer Hammer & Chisel, now called Discord Inc, initially created Discord for the MOBA game Fates Forever. <br>
                    The service has been popularized by eSports and LAN tournament players, including popular users on the Twitch streaming service and gaming communities like Star Citizen. The company, which has the same name as the service, was founded by OpenFeint founder Jason Citron, who intends to remain an independent company.<br>
                
                    The company raised an additional $20 million in funding for the software in January 2016.<br>
                
                    Starting in June 2020, Discord announced that it was shifting focus from video games specifically to a more comprehensive all-purpose chat and communication client, unveiling its new tagline “Your place to talk” along with an overhauled website . Among other planned changes would be reducing the number of game inside jokes it uses on the client, improving the user onboarding experience, and increasing server capacity and reliability. The company announced that it has received an additional $100 million in investment to help with these changes.</p>

                <h1 class="card-title2">According to Citron</h1>
                <p class="card-info2">During the development process, he noticed how difficult it was for his team to work out tactics in games like Final Fantasy XIV and League of Legends using available voice over IP (VoIP) software. This led to the development of a chat service with a focus on user friendliness with minimal impact on performance. The name Discord was chosen because it "sounds cool and has to do with talking", was easy to say, spell, remember, and was available for trademark and website. In addition, "Discord in the gaming community" was the problem they wished to solve.[14]</p>
